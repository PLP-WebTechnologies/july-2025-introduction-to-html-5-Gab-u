            <h2>About Bicycles</h2>
            <p>Bicycles are simple yet powerful machines that offer an efficient, eco-friendly mode of transportation. Powered by human effort, they require no fuel, produce no emissions, and promote physical fitness. Whether used for commuting, recreation, or sport, bicycles provide an accessible way to travel while reducing traffic congestion and improving overall health. Their design has evolved over centuries, but their value remains timeless.</p>
